These scripts take care of Cufon font replacement.

In the fonts folder you will find a collection of fonts that were generated by the cufon generator:
http://cufon.shoqolate.com/

Fonts that you put into the fonts folder will automatically show in the select box on the theme settings form.
PNG image files will also automatically load into the theme settings form, so if you want to add images, make sure they are properly resized.

The fonts that are in the theme by default contain the following glyphs:
-Basic Latin uppercase letters (A-Z). (26 glyphs)
-Basic Latin lowercase letters (a-z). (26 glyphs)
-Basic Latin digits (0-9). (10 glyphs)
-Basic Latin punctuation (!@#%...). (33 glyphs)
-Basic Latin glyphs within the Unicode range 0x0020 to 0x007E. (95 glyphs)

All fonts included can be used freely for both commercial and non-commercial projects, and can be distributed, though some fonts do require you pack the license file together with the font file(s).
See the respective license files of the fonts for more information about their terms of use.
